# Fix Canada Real Quick
## Key things that should 💯% be adopted in Canada

### 1. Push back the voting age 📪

Currently, in Canada, the **voting age is 18** and in some places like **Alberta the DRIVING AGE IS 14.**

Like, think about how crazy it is that there are 14 year olds just going around in deadly machines, when they aren't even old enough to help shape the country's future.

### 2. Adopt indigenous 7 generations rule and other teachings 🟠🪶

The most important rule we could follow is the **indigenous 7 generations rule**, it works like this:

- **Thinking about the interests of 7 generations in the past**

- **Thinking about the interests of 7 generations in the future**

With this system we **have to think** before doing things - like the pipelines, which will destroy our climate even further.

Pipelines will

- **Poison water Supplies**

- **Increase wildfires** due to oil spills and leaks

- **Kill native species**

Which could've all been prevented with the 7 generations rule.

Indigenous peoples have literally been around caring for our planet, since before Canada was even "discovered" by Europe, and in **just the past 200 years**, the **actions of us**, **corporations**, and the **government** have caused **Climate Change to quickly destroy** our beloved planet. Its very possible that **lions could go extinct as soon as 2050**.

### 3. Take climate action 🌊

The climate is a **HUGE** issue right now:

- **Oceans are rising** - if this continues places like Miami, New York, Amsterdam, and Eastern Canada could go completely underwater

- **Oil, natural gas** and other non-renewable sources are **poisoning water**, **rising temperatures** and making weather conditions unsuitable such as **more hurricanes, tornadoes, and tsunamis**

We can stop this by working together to:
- **Reuse** plastic
- Use **renewable energy** sources
- Use **less plastic**
- Use **electric appliances**
- **Fight back against** major polluters like **factories** and **mines**

### ✨ Take action NOW ✨

You are **NEVER** too young to take action. You can do so much no matter your age such as

- **Sharing this message**

- **Writing to your MP**

- **Sharing** this knowledge **with adults**

- **Taking part in petitions** (theres no minimum age!)

Our planet isn't lost - it's just waiting for **YOU** ❤️🌍
