# Hi there 👋

## Im Wdboyes13, and I love programming whatever I feel like  
  
I beleive that, if you have an idea, it can be made with the right skills    
I ❤️ C and HATE C++  
I ❤️ Open Source Software  
Building Apples "Open Source" stuff is like trying to assemble an IKEA Bed with missing screws and instructions in french  
  
My GPG Public key for encryption is available at --> https://github.com/Wdboyes13/Wdboyes13/blob/main/WillPubKey.asc  
  
## My main languages are:      
- Shell   
- C (Favourite) and as a side effect Assembly

## Some quotes about C++
"Quite frankly, even if   
the choice of C were to do *nothing* but keep the C++ programmers out,   
that in itself would be a huge reason to use C."  - Linus Torvalds (Creator of Linux Kernel & Git)  
  
"There are only two things wrong with C++: The initial concept and the implementation." – Bertrand Meyer  

"C++ is like jamming a helicopter inside a Miata and expecting some sort of improvement." – Drew Olbrich  

"If C++ has taught me one thing, it’s this: Just because the system isconsistent doesn’t 
mean it’s not the work of Satan." – Andrew Plotkin
  
"C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg." – Bjarne Stroustrup (Creator of C++)
