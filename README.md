# Hi there 👋

## I'm Wdboyes13, and I love programming whatever I feel like  
  
I believe that if you have an idea, it can be made with the right skills.  
I ❤️ C  
I ❤️ Open Source Software  
Building Apple’s "Open Source" stuff is like trying to assemble an IKEA bed with missing screws and instructions in French.
