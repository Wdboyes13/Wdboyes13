# Hi there üëã

## I'm Wdboyes13, and I love programming whatever I feel like  
  
I believe that if you have an idea, it can be made with the right skills.  
I ‚ù§Ô∏è C  
I ‚ù§Ô∏è Open Source Software  
Building Apple‚Äôs "Open Source" stuff is like trying to assemble an IKEA bed with missing screws and instructions in French.
