# Hi there 👋

## Im Wdboyes13, and I love programming whatever I feel like  
  
I beleive that, if you have an idea, it can be made with the right skills    
I ❤️ C and HATE C++  
I ❤️ Open Source Software  
Building Apples "Open Source" stuff is like trying to assemble an IKEA Bed with missing screws and instructions in french  
  
My GPG Public key for encryption is available at --> https://github.com/Wdboyes13/Wdboyes13/blob/main/WillPubKey.asc  
  
My main languages are:  
- Java    
- Shell  
- C (Favourite) and as a side effect Assembly

About my pins (If my code scares you, go back to python)

"Quite frankly, even if   
the choice of C were to do *nothing* but keep the C++ programmers out,   
that in itself would be a huge reason to use C."  - Linus Torvalds (Creator of Linux Kernel & Git)
