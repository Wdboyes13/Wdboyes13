# Hi there 👋

## I'm Wdboyes13, and I love programming whatever I feel like  
  
I believe that if you have an idea, it can be made with the right skills.  
I ❤️ C and HATE C++  
I ❤️ Open Source Software  
Building Apple’s "Open Source" stuff is like trying to assemble an IKEA bed with missing screws and instructions in French.

## My Main Languages  
- Shell  
- C (Favourite) — and by side effect, Assembly

## Some Quotes About C++

> "Quite frankly, even if the choice of C were to do *nothing* but keep the C++ programmers out, that in itself would be a huge reason to use C."  
> — **Linus Torvalds** (creator of the Linux kernel & Git)  

> "There are only two things wrong with C++: The initial concept and the implementation."  
> — **Bertrand Meyer**

> "C++ is like jamming a helicopter inside a Miata and expecting some sort of improvement."  
> — **Drew Olbrich**

> "If C++ has taught me one thing, it’s this: Just because the system is consistent doesn’t mean it’s not the work of Satan."  
> — **Andrew Plotkin**

> "C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg."  
> — **Bjarne Stroustrup** (creator of C++)
