# Hi there üëã

## I'm Wdboyes13, and I love programming whatever I feel like  
  
I believe that if you have an idea, it can be made with the right skills.  
I ‚ù§Ô∏è C++  
I ‚ù§Ô∏è Open Source Software  
Building Apple‚Äôs "Open Source" stuff is like trying to assemble an IKEA bed with missing screws and instructions in French.

## Warning about Package IDs  
After August 14, 2025 14:30 Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7) I will no longer use the 'com.william' Package ID.  
Instead, to conform with standards, __ANY NEWER__ packages, will use 'ca.weelam' as the Package ID (Reverse of my registered domain, weelam.ca).  
However, this does NOT invalidate any previous things using 'com.william'.
