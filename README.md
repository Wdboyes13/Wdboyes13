# Hi there üëã

## I'm Wdboyes13, and I love programming whatever I feel like  
  
I believe that if you have an idea, it can be made with the right skills.  
I ‚ù§Ô∏è C  
I ‚ù§Ô∏è Open Source Software  
Building Apple‚Äôs "Open Source" stuff is like trying to assemble an IKEA bed with missing screws and instructions in French.  
  
My GPG Public Key for encryption is available at ‚Üí  
https://github.com/Wdboyes13/Wdboyes13/blob/main/WillPubKey.asc  
  
And my GPG Public Key for Signing (Releases & Commits) is available at ‚Üí  
https://github.com/Wdboyes13/Wdboyes13/blob/main/willdev2025.asc  
Old one at https://github.com/Wdboyes13/Wdboyes13/blob/main/willdev2025-old.asc  
  
## My Main Languages  
- Java
- Shell  
- C (Favourite) ‚Äî and by side effect, Assembly
- Learning C++

## Warning about Package IDs  
After August 14, 2025 14:30 Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7) I will no longer use the 'com.william' Package ID.  
Instead, to conform with standards, __ANY NEWER__ packages, will use 'ca.weelam' as the Package ID (Reverse of my registered domain, weelam.ca).  
However, this does NOT invalidate any previous things using 'com.william'.
